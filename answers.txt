Selective β1 adrenergic receptor antagonist
Nonselective beta- adrenergic receptor antagonist
Increases extracellular concentrations of catecholamines by 1) blocking their reuptake into presynaptic nerve terminal, and by 2) inducing their release; ; occurs both centrally and peripherally
Increases extracellular concentrations of catecholamines and serotonin by inducing their release from presynaptic terminals, both in CNS and PNS
Increases extracellular concentrations of catecholamines by blocking their reuptake from presynaptic terminal, CNS and PNS: stimulating all adrenergic receptor types; Can lead to vasoconstriction in vasculature Na+ channel blocker;
Less potent analog of amphetamine; increase extracellular concentrations of catecholamines by blocking their reuptake from the synapse and inducing their release, both CNS and PNS; Direct agonist effects on post synaptic adrenergic receptors
Has amphetamine-like properties at the noradrenergic terminal but less poten
Metabolized by MAO (mostly MAO A) in periphery; if nonselective MAO inhibitor taken, then tyramine not metabolized and will be absorbed and taken up into presynaptic adrenergic terminals by NE transporters; tyramine then displaces NE from storage vesicles and NE is released
Depletes norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine neuronal content by binding to VMAT2 with high affinity and irreversibly blocking uptake of he monoamines into secretory vesicles
Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor
Dihydropyridine calcium channel/receptor (DHPR) antagonist
Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel/receptor antagonist
Competitive inhibition of ACh at postganglionic cholinergic receptors; no actions at NMJ; has both PNS and CNS effects (i.e., can cross the BBB)
Exogenous, parenteral form of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
Decreases preload via venodilation that leads to decreases in myocardial O₂ demand; also dilates coronary arteries and relieves coronary spasm
Organic nitrate prodrug → bioactivated in vascular smooth muscle; releases NO → reduces preload by NO- mediated cGMP accumulation causing predominant venodilation
(IV/PO/etc) Organic nitrate prodrug → bioactivated in vascular smooth muscle; releases NO → reduces preload by NO- mediated cGMP accumulation causing predominant venodilation
Releases NO directly→ sGC → cGMP → smooth-muscle relaxation, causing rapid, balanced arterial and venous dilation; cyanide detoxified to thiocyanate
Lowers blood pressure by directly dilating arterioles, reducing SVR and afterload, with reflex sympathetic activation
Elevation of cytosolic Na+ concentration by partial suppression of Na+/K+ pump; elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentration via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
